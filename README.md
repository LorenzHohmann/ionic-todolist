# ionic-todolist

This is my first web application build with ionic included angular. You can handle your own todos.

## Installation
1. Clone repository with `https://github.com/LorenzHohmann/ionic-todolist.git` to your local repository
2. Install all node modules with `npm install`
3. Start ionic server with `ionic serve`. A browser window with the web application is opened now. Have fun! :)
