# ionic-todolist

This is my first web application build with ionic included angular. You can handle your own todos.

## Installation
1. Clone repository with `git clone https://github.com/LorenzHohmann/ionic-todolist.git` to your local repository
2. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and the [ionic framework](https://ionicframework.com/).
3. Install all node modules with `npm install`
4. Start ionic server with `ionic serve`. A browser window with the web application is opened now. Have fun! :)
